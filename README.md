<h2>Program Reference</h2>


jServ is extremely flexible. There are very few definite terms provided, as most of it depends on the implementation by the individual developer.


<h3>Data Structure</h3>


The data structure relies on three classes, `DataObject`, `AttributeContainer`, and `Collection`. 
 

`DataObject` is the class that all instances in the database come from. When serialized as a JSON object, it appears as the following (with example values),
```json
{
    "id": 0,
    "data": {"some-key": "some-value"}
}
```

The reason the object has only two fields is that the developer defines what attributes each object will have within the `data` field. The `id` field is the only definite field to any object, as it is required for the API to be functional. It is dependent on the developer to ensure that the data field is consistent across all objects(if this is what is desired).
 
<br>

`AttributeContainer` is a class that serves the sole purpose of being a proxy between JSON objects passed in the API requests. When serialized as a JSON object, it appears as the following (with example values),
```json
{
    "some-key": "some-value"
}
```

Some of the requests requre a single value to be passed in to the request body in the form of an `AttributeContainer` object, as this is the only way to maintain flexible typing within the database. The `AttributeContainer` class acts as a model within the program to translate that data seamlessly to the `Collection` and `DataObject` classes.
 
<br>

`Collection` is simply a container within the program for a database and its name. When written as a JSON object, it appears as the following (with example values),

```json
{
    "name": "some-string",
    "dataList": [
        {
        "id": 0,
        "data": {"some-key": "some-value"}
        }
    ]
}
```

The `Collection` class exists to keep track of each database within the server. Within the program, the name corresponds to a filename in the `Databases` folder, which is what comprises the `dataList` in the class.


<h3>API Reference</h3>

jServ's API is built around a system of specific requests and query parameters.


<h4>GET Requests</h4>
 
<dl>
    <dt><code>__/query</code></dt>
    <dd>
    Queries a collection for a specific object by id. Returns the whole object in JSON.
    <br>
    Query Parameters:
        <ul>
            <li>q - The name of the collection you're querying
            <li>id - The id of the object you're querying
        </ul>
    </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
    <dt><code>__/query/attribute</code></dt>
    <dd>
    Queries a collection for a specific attribute of an object by id and name. Returns the attribute value in an <code>AttributeContainer</code> object.
    <br>
    Query Parameters:
        <ul>
            <li>q - The name of the collection you're querying
            <li>id - The id of the object you're querying
            <li>a - the name of the attribute you're querying
        </ul>
    </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
    <dt><code>__/query/allAttributes</code></dt>
    <dd>
    Queries a collection for all attributes of a specific key in every object. If an object does not have an attribute of the passed key, the object is skipped. The query returns a list of all the attributes keyed by object id.
    <br>
    Query Parameters:
        <ul>
            <li>q - The name of the collection you're querying
            <li>a - the name of the attributes you're querying
        </ul>
    </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
    <dt><code>__/query/newId</code></dt>
    <dd>
    Checks if an object of the given id exists within a collection
    <br>
    Query Parameters:
        <ul>
            <li>q - The name of the collection you're querying
            <li>id - the id you're checking
